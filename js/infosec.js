  {q:"What does CIA stand for in information security?",a:["Central Intelligence Agency","Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability","Computer Information Access","Certified Information Assurance"],c:1,exp:"CIA in InfoSec refers to the three core principles: Confidentiality (protecting data from unauthorized access), Integrity (ensuring data accuracy), and Availability (ensuring systems are accessible when needed). This is not related to the intelligence agency."},
  {q:"Which attack involves sending excessive requests to crash a system?",a:["Phishing","DoS Attack","SQL Injection","Man-in-the-Middle"],c:1,exp:"A Denial of Service (DoS) attack overwhelms a system with traffic or requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users. Phishing steals credentials, SQL Injection exploits databases, and MITM intercepts communications."},
  {q:"What is the primary purpose of encryption?",a:["Speed up data transfer","Protect confidentiality","Increase storage space","Delete viruses"],c:1,exp:"Encryption converts data into unreadable format to protect confidentiality, ensuring only authorized parties with the decryption key can access it. It doesn't speed up transfers, increase storage, or remove malware."},
  {q:"Which is NOT a type of malware?",a:["Virus","Worm","Firewall","Trojan"],c:2,exp:"A firewall is a security device that filters network traffic, not malware. Viruses, worms, and Trojans are all malicious software types that harm systems in different ways."},
  {q:"What does a firewall primarily do?",a:["Scans for viruses","Filters network traffic","Encrypts all data","Creates backups"],c:1,exp:"Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules, blocking unauthorized access.

Performance, cost, and storage are IT concerns, not security goals."},
  {q:"Which property is violated when data is changed by an unauthorized party?",a:["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","Authenticity"],c:1,exp:"Integrity ensures data remains accurate and unmodified. When unauthorized changes occur, integrity is compromised. Confidentiality relates to unauthorized viewing, availability to system access."},
  {q:"A DDoS attack primarily affects which CIA property?",a:["Confidentiality","Integrity","Availability","All three"],c:2,exp:"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks overwhelm systems with traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate users.

  {q:"What does a man-in-the-middle attack usually target?",a:["Availability","Confidentiality & Integrity","Only integrity","Only availability"],c:1,exp:"MITM attacks intercept communications between two parties, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop (violating confidentiality) and potentially modify messages (violating integrity). Both CIA properties are at risk."},
  {q:"Malware that spreads without user interaction is called a:",a:["Virus","Trojan","Worm","Rootkit"],c:2,exp:"Worms self-replicate and spread across networks without user action. Viruses need host files and user execution. Trojans disguise themselves but don't self-replicate. Rootkits hide malware presence."},
  {q:"Which is typically used to achieve confidentiality?",a:["Hashing","Digital signature","Symmetric encryption","Checksum"],c:2,exp:"Symmetric encryption (like AES) scrambles data to protect confidentiality, requiring a secret key to decrypt. Hashing and checksums verify integrity. Digital signatures verify authenticity and integrity."},
  {q:"A logic bomb is triggered by:",a:["Network traffic","Specific condition or event","User login","Antivirus scan"],c:1,exp:"A logic bomb is malicious code that activates when specific conditions are met (date, time, user action, deleted account). It lies dormant until triggered, unlike viruses that activate immediately."},
  {q:"What does DLP stand for?",a:["Data Loss Prevention","Disk Logging Protocol","Direct Link Protection","Data Load Protection"],c:0,exp:"Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems monitor and control data transfers to prevent sensitive information from leaving the organization. They detect and block unauthorized data exfiltration attempts."},

Attackers can exploit them before developers have time ('zero days') to create and distribute fixes."},
  {q:"Which is NOT a strong authentication method?",a:["Biometrics + PIN","Password + security question","Fingerprint + OTP","Smart card + PIN"],c:1,exp:"Password and security questions are both 'something you know' (single factor). Strong 2FA requires two different factor types: knowledge, possession, or inherence. The other options combine different factors."},
  {q:"What does MFA stand for?",a:["Multi-Factor Authentication","Multiple Firewall Access","Managed File Access","Multi-Factor Analysis"],c:0,exp:"Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires two or more authentication factors for stronger security. It's an extension of 2FA, potentially requiring three or more factors for high-security scenarios."},
  {q:"A rootkit is dangerous because it:",a:["Encrypts files","Hides malicious processes","Steals passwords only","Slows down the system"],c:1,exp:"Rootkits modify the operating system to conceal malware, making detection extremely difficult.

  {q:"Which helps prevent CSRF attacks?",a:["SameSite cookies & anti-CSRF tokens","Strong passwords","HTTPS only","Antivirus"],c:0,exp:"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks forge requests from authenticated users. Anti-CSRF tokens validate request origin, and SameSite cookies prevent cross-site requests. HTTPS and passwords don't prevent CSRF."},
  {q:"What is a replay attack?",a:["Capturing and resending valid data","Playing audio files","Repeating phishing","Replaying video"],c:0,exp:"Replay attacks intercept and retransmit valid network communications (like authentication tokens) to impersonate users.

Compromised DMZ servers can't directly access internal resources."},
  {q:"Which is a network segmentation benefit?",a:["Limits lateral movement","Increases attack surface","Slows patching","Reduces monitoring"],c:0,exp:"Network segmentation divides networks into isolated zones, limiting attackers' ability to move laterally after initial compromise. It reduces blast radius and contains breaches to smaller areas."},
  {q:"What does a proxy server primarily provide?",a:["Anonymity & filtering","Encryption","Authentication","Backup"],c:0,exp:"Proxy servers act as intermediaries, providing anonymity by hiding client IP addresses and enabling content filtering.
